This Foundry VTT module displays colored diamonds/squares/circles to represent the players who have limited/observer/owner ownership of Documents (Actors, Journals, Items, Cards, Macros, etc..).

It makes it very easy to see at a glance which journal, actor, item, etc. is shared with your players. The shapes are :

* Diamond : Limited ownership
* Square : Observer ownership
* Circle : Full ownership

The color of the dots represents the color of the player. In the case of a default ownership set for `All Players`, the shape will have the Blue/Yellow/Green/Red colors.
